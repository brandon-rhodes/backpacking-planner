     over to left, then Comanche Point member, then Solomon Temple past Cardenas
     mouth, then Escalante Creek member as bed of 75mile is descended.  Up at
     Beamer, Tapeats is atop Escalante Creek member.

RAFTER CAMPS. “Palisades” across from Chuar “Above Espejo” below mouth
previous drainage “Espejo” ABANDONED above mouth “Comanche” just below
mouth “Below Tanner” camp just before turn left “69.7” ABANDONED east

75mile “Papago” at mouth “Hance” just above Red Canyon “Lower Hance”
0.4mi below Red Canyon

SIGHTS.  Beamer cabin east of Confluence.  Palisades: Cabin ruin “few
hundred yards” away from River.  Shortcut Tanner to Cardenas 3600ft
around to saddle, down crest.  Cardenas route from Esc/Car buttes
saddle.  Anasazi ruin on hilltop above Cardenas Creek.  Butchart Gap
sleeps 5.  75mile can be climbed to Tanner.  Red Canyon “streambed is
rock-lined where the trail enters the bed and a rock platform by a large
boulder ... makes a good campsite with water often available”. Hance
Creek “a tiring but worthwhile day's trip down to the River and back”.

“Routes exist up 75Mile Creek…and also upslope to the west from the
inside of a bend in the narrows. The west arm of Papago goes through to
a difficult but nearly safe climb up to the Shimumo terrace (connects
upriver with Seventyfive Mile), and climbers have passed up from there
all the way to the rim.”

PAPAGO. “easy access into the upper portions along the ledge above the
fall on the west side, and the east side is also possible... Soon a 50
foot fall blocks the way, but again the west ledge permits access at a
point well down the bed from the fall. Past several small falls, the bed
takes a major fork. The west fork ends at a huge fall, but the east fork
continues, bypassing the fall at the fork. Several more small falls and
then there is a big one, climbable with a little care. Finally the route
seems to end at a rock basin at the bottom of a 300 foot pouroff. The
only possible exit, the jagged white chute to the east, goes all the way
to the top of the quartzite in an increasingly difficult and exposed
climb (big holds and firm rock). At the top of the chute a deer trail
traverses an exposed section of narrow slope to the top of the pouroff.”
