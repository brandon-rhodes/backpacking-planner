HAUNTED: Spring=impressive; when coming back down look for arch high on W wall.

UPPER PHANTOM: Starts@ 20ft waterfall. Trail to N side, campsite, S side, mile,
Overhang Camp. 2 optional crossings to get past Haunted intersection. N. High
to get past brush in tree swampy area. Hippie Springs. Walk upstream in creek.
“Bypasses generally exist for the difficult obstacles if you look for them.
The Muav layer is short lived and you will start encountering bigger waterfalls
when you get into the Temple Butte Formation. The first few are about 10 feet
high. Scramble up and around them. The going will get more difficult and you
will begin battling both brush and the boulders. About half a mile up Phantom
from Hippie Camp you will encounter a very attractive 20 foot waterfall that
falls beneath a van-sized chockstone. I thought this was the end of my journey,
but looking closely there is a scramble to the left that looked "doable". …
20 foot long, 8 foot high waterslide into a deep pool. This may be the end for
many, but for the adventurous, there is a little more to see. Scrambling up the
waterfall isn't too difficult and oh boy will you be rewarded…in springtime!”

TRINITY: “THERE IS NO ACCESS TO THE COLORADO RIVER.” “A short distance from the
confluence with the east arm is what is known as the Trinity Tanks, which is
where a small seep can usually be found.”

CHEOPS PYRAMID (NOT Plateau): sidehill E side to S of summit; climb.
“follow a series of class III ledges up… There are occasional cairns
along the way, but it isn't overly complicated, and a number of
variations are possible. Once at the small summit, you can find a
register tucked under a small cairn, only averaging 1-2 parties/year.”
West side: start at N 4800, stay fairly high, wind up W side of bridge(!).

CATTLE ROUTE: “There is only a few short sections of this route where a faint
trail is visible. Most of it is just cross-country over the Bright Angel shale.
Just image the Tonto trail but with no trail and an overload of hedgehog and
prickly pear cactus.”

“Another would be to see if I could drop down 91-Mile Creek to the river; I've
had an eye on that route for some time, and I've been told it can be done.”

“SE of Cheops, and just east of 91-mile is an interesting river-side
mesa, which includes Peak 3950, that'd be fun to explore.”
