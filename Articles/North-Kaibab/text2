This essay  is for hiker

NKT layer cake
for whom cliffs are waypoints

Essentially,
this is the essay I wish I could have read
before my youthful attempt to hike
from the South Rim to the river to the North Rim
on the South and North Kaibab Trails.

Because the hiker prepared to be led across the wide Canyon by geology
is the hiker who in fact will be tempted, deceived, and mislead by geology.

basically oriented
coconino cliffs  redwall  basement rocks

We can imagine our hiker familiar with one last word: “Tapeats”.
While the Tapeats are not as famous as the ,
the hiker will have encountered them on day hikes —
they are the cap from which he has gazed from Plateau Point,
or the Great Unconformity along BAT.

So our hiker begins his descent
armed with a schematic view of the Canyon,
learned along the South Rim.

## Loomings

To provide him with a generous head start,
we imagine our hiker to be responsible.
He is hiking as early in the year as he can manage:
in early June, rather than the furnace months of July or August.
He is careful to catch the early Hikers’ Express shuttle, not the late,
?am.

We grant our hiker generous knowledge
Several times Plateau Point layers

As this is the hiker’s first descent of the South Kaibab,
he is buoyed by perpetual pleasant surprise
at how rapidly dispatches layers
compared to bright angel
A series of swift switchbacks
soon deliver him to the Coconino Cliffs and ooah point,
then a long unbroken diagonal brings him to the top of the Redwall.
At the bottom Tonto Platform and the Tip Off.

The South Kaibab strikes our hiker
as not only a more expansive trail than the Bright Angel —
open to vast views to one or both sides,
instead of always crawling along one side of a valley
with a view of the other —
but as more
There seem to be fewer tourists (especially at this hour)
and a larger proportion of serious hikers:
Park materials warn tourists away from the SKT
since it offers no water,
and its trailhead is at the end of a shuttle ride
instead of sitting in Grand Canyon village itself.

Perhaps making as much as three miles per hour downhill,
the hiker can reach the Tonto Platform and the Tip Off
within the first two hours of the hike,
which already puts most of the familiar layers of the Canyon
behind him.
Only a few minutes more
and he is descending into the Tapeats,
the final
before he passes the Great Unconformity
and descends the ancient granites and schists
that wall the Colorado River itself.
While, yes, the NKT north of the River will be twice the length
of the South Kaibab along which he has descended,
the hiker feels justified in concluding that — geologically —
the hike is nearly half over.

Alas!

Giddy with the early morning
as he breaches the Tapeats
and descends towards the River,
all the hiker sees are the simple and schematic rocks across the river:
the corrugated Tapeats capping the gray and pink swirls
of the basement rocks
whose cliffs angle sharply down into Upper Granite Gorge.

In awe at the view,
in a hurry to reach the River,
eyes at huh the mighty monuments to the north,
the hiker does not stop to ponder a puzzle:
what, exactly, is the loose red layer they’re actually standing on?
The hiker fails to see beneath his own feet,
for there a mystery lies.
If, as BAT geology has taught him to expect,
the Tapeats everywhere overlies the basement rocks,
then why is the SKT making lazily swoops
across a loose red sandstone
with no analog along the more familiar BAT?

PIC

This is the first inkling
that the Canyon’s geology will not nearly as simple
as the hiker expects.

This loose red sandstone, as it happens, is named the Hakatai Shale.
When the hiker’s feet encounter it next,
it will be in a wide desert valley of baking sunlight,
shimmering haze, and little shade.

The SKT troubles him with the incongruity its incongruousness
for what seems like only a few moments.
Soon enough his feet is on basement rock,
and the final switchbacks as he approaches the tunnel and Black Bridge
are carved into the ancient granite and schist of the basement.

But though the hiker has ignored it,
the Canyon has now issued its warning.
The hiker, plunging on heedless,
reaches the River in record time,
stops for a photo on the famous Black Bridge,
then refills his water at the spigots an actual sink
beneath beautiful trees of the Bright Angel Campground.

Now, it’s time to make the trip back uphill.

# Moving the goalpost

Look back again at photo above
Above Hak, at layer marked Tap.

Do the Tapeats appear rather gradiose in their height?

PIC of H above trail; hmm

Alas, the hiker is distracted:
the Sun’s aggressive warmth
is already starting to bake the trail
as the trail passes Phantom Ranch
and enters the winding granite
as the Box.
If only the hiker would stop,
lift their eyes skyward,
and try to guess the altitude of Taps.

Turning now to the first third of our geology map,
will show clearly what the hiker fails to notice as they hurry north.

GEO1

Because our Bright Angel hiker
knows of nothing beneath the Tapeats but the basement.
an return ascent into the Tapeats is the next milestone they expect.
Not sure when in the 14 miles of ascent it might occur,
but they want to make progress against it.

PIC of H here, maybe?

Alas!

The Canyon has quietly but emphatically pulled away the Tapeats.
far away far above

Remembering that the geologic section is of the inside of the wall
X distance west,
inside the hill to the hiker’s left,
the T elevations it shows
are not necessarily those
are higher than those
exaggerate those the hiker will see;
the T are in fact in fact a couple of hundred feet lower
than the 4000ft.
Left wall will present
the

but the hiker isn’t looking up
as they wind through the box
as they go deeper into the box,
passing CCC,
layers near the trail are usually familiar basement rocks

Alas!
the Canyon has quietly set them back
at least two hours (?)
from the ,
without the hiker even noticing.

# Into the great wide open

The sun might not yet be high enough
to shine directly into the NKT as it winds through the Box,
but the temperature is climbing as it arcs further into the sky.

focused on what mighty feats of old
CCC

then the hiker turns a last corner,
the familiar basement rocks fall away to either side,
and into a wide something? valley stretching north.
The twists and turns of the Box
tended towards the claustrophobic:
he could only see a bit ahead and behind / a few minutes a&b.

(PIC?)

But now the hiker feels like he can see miles ahead.

GEO2

The hiker is now passing Mile 4 of their trek north,
where —
as we, with the benefit of Billingsley’s section, can see —
are now leaving the familiar basement rocks behind.
But instead of ascending back into the corrugated Tapeats,
as they expect,
the hiker emerges into a wide wilderness of talus and broken rock.

Alas!
that they have entered the supergroup
sandstones and shales canted at an angle
have replaced the familiar basement.
the hiker is now entirely out of reckoning:
the basement rocks are simply gone.

It’s true that the hiker will now make better progress north.
Look back at the first geology diagram,
and notice how much more closely the mileposts bunch.
There, consumed by twists and turns of the Box.
Now each mile of walking now takes the hiker farther up BAC than before.
note how the mileposts stretch across this diagram
compared to how they were bunched together in the first diagram:
the costly twists and turns of the Box
have been replaced with a far more straight-running trail
stretching up into the desert valley.

Everything familiar is gone.
On what rocks are they hiking now?

The legend of our geology map gives us the answer:
the X Y Z,
the layers of the Grand Canyon Supergroup.

What’s the Supergroup?

They are the Canyon layers
that defy it
They aren’t level
aren’t consistent
aren’t easily visible from rim?

the hiker, alas, does not find it clear on the ground.

For one thing, as the day continues to grow hotter,
the hiker is focusing more on their feet
than the clifftops above them.

(hiker sense to wear long clothing; but not trekking umbrella)

For another,
the very structure of this part of?
BAC discourages close study of its walls.
While the hard basement rocks presented dizzying cliffs
that the hiker can reach easily and touch,
the Supergroup are instead soft and friable:
sandstones and blah-stones
eroding gradually toward the center
of the broad gentle valley in which the hiker now finds himself.
Instead of a clean cliff to either side,
the trail is now flanked by wide talus slopes
that nearly bury the rocks underneath.

The Supergroup does not entirely stay mysterious
hide itself
stay hidden

PIC


when hiking below south rim,
the hiker is hiking a diagram
every layer visible exposed as in a textbook

but here, stuff about layers talus

the layers do poke out
but how can the hiker recognize them?
never seen them before

PIC

this is like nothing they have seen
this is the Canyon’s quiet rebuke
for the hiker’s inattention on South Kaibab,
where the H was
as alluring curvy slopes

But here the H stands as an imposing cliff,
trapping the hiker in the valley
close enough imposing, but far enough to provide no shade

the Canyon has pulled
chaos
disorder
as the heat begins to feel almost like a molten liquid
rolling down the talus slopes to cover?overwhelm? the hiker,
all their reference points have been pulled away
monsters quote?

## two steps forward — one step back

climb becomes more serious?
(is it just because of straighter? or no wait opposite?)
surely that will bring an end to this chaos and waste
surely out there in front of him, somewhere,
the familiar Canyon must still exist,
the familiar layers be waiting
to meter and gauge the climb from these chaos
up to the order precision of the North Rim?

why taking so long?

the hiker will suddenly find themselves with more time to think
as one of their companions begins to stumble,
then flush a slight red in the blazing sun,
then stagger under the weight of the heat.
this gives the hiker more time to think
as they sit for several minutes
wedged with their companions
in the dangerously small shadow
of a small trailside cliff
when they are able to move again,
their slow pace will encourage more observation
and two whole hours will be offered at Cottonwood Campground
for geologic observations
as their companion sleeps of his heat stroke? exhaustion?
beneath the shady whatever trees of the ranger station

why aren’t they at the Tapeats yet

they should be
[do numbers]

the answer is easy enough
to us in our armchairs,
and has been evident from the very first geology section:
the Tapeats are receding
the Canyon has doubled down even harder
having first yanked the Tapeats twice? as high,
the Canyon not content
has been slowing ever higher

this is clear enough to us,
looking at Billingsley’s diagrams
with their 2× vertical exaggeration.

but the hiker not only hasn’t the benefit of the geologic map.
he has also been denied
for the Tapeats are not everywhere equally exposed
where they are exposed along the trail,
they vary in thickness more than the diagram might suggest
and at the outlet of Ribbon Falls
they are for a moment entirely absent!

PIC

as shown above
hikers with the leisure to hike above Ribbon Falls
get to enjoy a butte of redwall
at the bottom of which the BA
was deposited directly atop the supergroup,
the T either never having been laid here
or already having been removed from this prominence or hill
before the Permian? Period and the sands? of the BA arrived.

but here at Cottonwood Campground the T stand obviously above
the hiker —
obviously, that is, above 4000ft of altitude,
the elevation of the campground itself.
and the hiker can see a beautiful butte? of T to the campground’s north
that stands even higher

PIC

even in this heat,
the truth must begin to dawn:
the Tapeats are receding to ever higher elevations
even as the weary hiker has labored for X hours
to escape the inner? canyon?
and bring them back return to them ascend to them
re-achieve them

[do some numbers!]

the hiker is now paying attention
as his companion wobbles gamely to his feet
and attempts a slow mile+? to the $MRA
where he again finds shade and collapses.
there is now no mistake:
the Tapeats is receding
with each footstep [do some numbers]

## [End]

Finally, the Canyon relents.
The $MRA sits against T!
At X elevation [numbers],
adrift in dazzle of heat
washed finally on a familiar shore

But with what labor the Canyon has exacted
before vouchsafing this return to a familiar shore!
[numbers]

Order has returned,
and

Not that it will entirely help:
it’s difficult to see layers in the dark
or to mark their mighty passage by headlamp.
The recovered companion as soon as the sun sets behind the T cliff
beside $MRA,
start hike uphill.

But the thing brief.
As they reach the top of the Redwall,
the hiker’s other companion —
who gave no problems all day —
will now begin to stagger himself.
No help cool breezes of evening.
Moving ever more slowly,
darkness will set upon the three
as they reach that area —
still X distance from the top.

And so the hiker will again have no gauge
against to measure progress
as the ex companion
is slowly coaxed uphill,
as the heat radiates from the cooling surface of the trail,
and in the cooling night
as the Canyon’s myriad of hidden insects
rush forth to war across the path.
While taking small steps for companion,
the hiker will see the secret wars caught in his headlamp:
X vs Y, Y harvesting, Z vs Z.

But this myopia will be the happenstance of circumstance,
not the design of the Canyon’s architecture.
Even as they climb in the dark,
the layers are going by:
supai, coco, etc.

Not only going by, but by in the same thickness.
Which completes for us, finally, the picture
of what has happened:
though the North Rim is X higher
[DRAT when do I mention slope of Kaibab Plat?]
it takes same elevation to go through T through K.

Therefore,
the entire difference in elevation
must be something else supergroup
hmm.

## [Conclusion]

The NKT does not merely challenge the hiker
with unrelenting climb
and cleverly decreasing amounts of shade
almost designed to correspond
so that the shade decreases in almost perfect proportion
with the growing heat.

The NK’s attack is also intellectual.
It wants the hiker not merely A but B
hot, but disoriented
weary, but hopeless
, but 

First, it lures the hiker below T
only to jack them X higher across the River.

Second, not satisfied,
it lets the hiker come back into view of the T
only to ratchet them slowly higher and higher
In the midday heat
the NK seems almost gleeful
about making the hiker feel
that they are climbing a down escalator:
ever stepping higher and higher
yet always seeing the rocks above them recede yeah.

Finally,
the NK lures the hiker fully halfway up the BAC valley
through familiar basement rocks
before sweeping that final anchor,
that last tinge? of link? to ?,
that last vestige of sanity,
away.
Having offered one last familiar prop and support
it then sheerly? knocks it away,
leaving the hiker to sprawl and gape among
searching for meaning, searching
for a familiar cliff somewhere in the bright wilderness of rock.
