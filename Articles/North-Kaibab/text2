## Loomings

hiker shuttle bus dawn kaibab trailhead

If this is the hiker’s first descent of the South Kaibab,
expect a pleasant surprise
at how rapidly dispatches layers
compared to bright angel
no water
with probably a smaller crowds
more a feeling of outdoors
wide open either side

in only two hours the hiker is likely to find tip off
and descend in triumph into the basement rocks
— feeling that their hike is, at least geologically,
now half over
though the map shows the north to be twice,
they have now covered half the geology they expect to:
all they need to do is re

Alas!
In their early morning jubilation
the hiker does not even notice that it is not,
in fact,
the basement rock into which they have descended.

PIC of hakatai

As trail drops below the Tapeats,
the hiker indeed sees cliffs of mighty basement rocks
angling down into Upper Granite Gorge.

In awe at the view,
in a hurry to reach the River,
eyes at huh the mighty monuments to the north,
the hiker does not stop to ponder a puzzle:
what, exactly, is the loose red layer they’re actually standing on?

Alas!
If only they paused to heed it,
this incongruity is the hiker’s warning
that 
the Bright Angel geology they expect.

The layer, as it happens, is named the Hakatai.
In fact sticking out

PIC

When the hiker’s feet encounter it next,
it will be in a wide desert valley of baking sunlight,
shimmering haze, and little shade.
The Canyon has issued its warning.
The hiker, plunging on heedless,
reaches the River in record time,
stops for a photo on the famous Black Bridge,
then refills his water at the spigots an actual sink
beneath beautiful trees of the Bright Angel Campground.

Now, it’s time to make the trip back uphill.

# The moving goalpost

Look back again at photo above
Above Hak, at layer marked Tap.

Do the Tapeats appear rather gradiose in their height?

Alas, the hiker is distracted:
the Sun’s aggressive warmth
is already starting to bake the trail
as the trail passes Phantom Ranch
and enters the winding granite
as the Box.
If only the hiker would stop,
lift their eyes skyward,
and try to guess the altitude of Taps.
The geology map will show clearly
what they don’t see.

GEO1

Because our Bright Angel hiker
knows of nothing beneath the Tapeats but the basement.
an return ascent into the Tapeats is the next milestone they expect.
Not sure when in the 14 miles of ascent it might occur,
but they want to make progress against it.

Alas!

The Canyon has quietly but emphatically pulled away the Tapeats.
far away far above

Remembering that the geologic section is of the inside of the wall
X distance west,
inside the hill to the hiker’s left,
the T elevations it shows
are not necessarily those
are higher than those
exaggerate those the hiker will see;
the T are in fact in fact a couple of hundred feet lower
than the 4000ft.
Left wall will present
the

but the hiker isn’t looking up
as they wind through the box
as they go deeper into the box,
passing CCC,
layers near the trail are usually familiar basement rocks

Alas!
the Canyon has quietly set them back
at least two hours (?)
from the ,
without the hiker even noticing.

# Into the great wide open



makes better progress north
note how the mileposts stretch across this diagram
compared to how they were bunched together in the first diagram:
the costly twists and turns of the Box
have been replaced with a far more straight-running trail
stretching up into the desert valley.

with the benefit of our geology diagrams,
we see clearly.
that they have entered the supergroup
sandstones and shales canted at an angle
have replaced the familiar basement.
the hiker is now entirely out of reckoning:
the basement rocks are simply gone.

all this is clear on the diagram.
the hiker, alas, does not find it clear on the ground.
for one thing, the day continues to grow hotter.
they focus more on their feet
and on the scenery right around them
rather than on the heights above

(hiker sense to wear long clothing; but not trekking umbrella)

but the other problem is structural
these are very soft layers
eroding into a broad gentle valley
instead of cliffs
this leaves high talus slopes
that in many cases entirely obscure the rocks themselves

when hiking below south rim,
the hiker is hiking a diagram
every layer visible exposed as in a textbook

but here, stuff about layers talus

PIC

the layers do poke out
but how can the hiker recognize them?
never seen them before

PIC

this is like nothing they have seen
this is the Canyon’s quiet rebuke
for the hiker’s inattention on South Kaibab,
where the H was
as alluring curvy slopes

But here the H stands as an imposing cliff,
trapping the hiker in the valley
close enough imposing, but far enough to provide no shade

the Canyon has pulled
chaos
disorder
as the heat begins to feel almost like a molten liquid
rolling down the talus slopes to cover?overwhelm? the hiker,
all their reference points have been pulled away
monsters quote?

## two steps forward — one step back

climb becomes more serious?
(is it just because of straighter? or no wait opposite?)
surely that will bring an end to this chaos and waste
surely out there in front of him, somewhere,
the familiar Canyon must still exist,
the familiar layers be waiting
to meter and gauge the climb from these chaos
up to the order precision of the North Rim?

why taking so long?

the hiker will suddenly find themselves with more time to think
as one of their companions begins to stumble,
then flush a slight red in the blazing sun,
then stagger under the weight of the heat.
this gives the hiker more time to think
as they sit for several minutes
wedged with their companions
in the dangerously small shadow
of a small trailside cliff
when they are able to move again,
their slow pace will encourage more observation
and two whole hours will be offered at Cottonwood Campground
for geologic observations
as their companion sleeps of his heat stroke? exhaustion?
beneath the shady whatever trees of the ranger station

why aren’t they at the Tapeats yet

they should be
[do numbers]

the answer is easy enough
to us in our armchairs,
and has been evident from the very first geology section:
the Tapeats are receding
the Canyon has doubled down even harder
having first yanked the Tapeats twice? as high,
the Canyon not content
has been slowing ever higher

this is clear enough to us,
looking at Billingsley’s diagrams
with their 2× vertical exaggeration.

but the hiker not only hasn’t the benefit of the geologic map.
he has also been denied
for the Tapeats are not everywhere equally exposed
where they are exposed along the trail,
they vary in thickness more than the diagram might suggest
and at the outlet of Ribbon Falls
they are for a moment entirely absent!

PIC

as shown above
hikers with the leisure to hike above Ribbon Falls
get to enjoy a butte of redwall
at the bottom of which the BA
was deposited directly atop the supergroup,
the T either never having been laid here
or already having been removed from this prominence or hill
before the Permian? Period and the sands? of the BA arrived.

but here at Cottonwood Campground the T stand obviously above
the hiker —
obviously, that is, above 4000ft of altitude,
the elevation of the campground itself.
and the hiker can see a beautiful butte? of T to the campground’s north
that stands even higher

PIC

even in this heat,
the truth must begin to dawn:
the Tapeats are receding to ever higher elevations
even as the weary hiker has labored for X hours
to escape the inner? canyon?
and bring them back return to them ascend to them
re-achieve them

[do some numbers!]

the hiker is now paying attention
as his companion wobbles gamely to his feet
and attempts a slow mile+? to the $MRA
where he again finds shade and collapses.
there is now no mistake:
the Tapeats is receding
with each footstep [do some numbers]

## [End]

Finally, the Canyon relents.
The $MRA sits against T!
At X elevation [numbers],
adrift in dazzle of heat
washed finally on a familiar shore

But with what labor the Canyon has exacted
before vouchsafing this return to a familiar shore!
[numbers]

Order has returned,
and

Not that it will entirely help:
it’s difficult to see layers in the dark
or to mark their mighty passage by headlamp.
The recovered companion as soon as the sun sets behind the T cliff
beside $MRA,
start hike uphill.

But the thing brief.
As they reach the top of the Redwall,
the hiker’s other companion —
who gave no problems all day —
will now begin to stagger himself.
No help cool breezes of evening.
Moving ever more slowly,
darkness will set upon the three
as they reach that area —
still X distance from the top.

And so the hiker will again have no gauge
against to measure progress
as the ex companion
is slowly coaxed uphill,
as the heat radiates from the cooling surface of the trail,
and in the cooling night
as the Canyon’s myriad of hidden insects
rush forth to war across the path.
While taking small steps for companion,
the hiker will see the secret wars caught in his headlamp:
X vs Y, Y harvesting, Z vs Z.

But this myopia will be the happenstance of circumstance,
not the design of the Canyon’s architecture.
Even as they climb in the dark,
the layers are going by:
supai, coco, etc.

Not only going by, but by in the same thickness.
Which completes for us, finally, the picture
of what has happened:
though the North Rim is X higher
[DRAT when do I mention slope of Kaibab Plat?]
it takes same elevation to go through T through K.

Therefore,
the entire difference in elevation
must be something else supergroup
hmm.

## [Conclusion]

The NKT does not merely challenge the hiker
with unrelenting climb
and cleverly decreasing amounts of shade
almost designed to correspond
so that the shade decreases in almost perfect proportion
with the growing heat.

The NK’s attack is also intellectual.
It wants the hiker not merely A but B
hot, but disoriented
weary, but hopeless
, but 

First, it lures the hiker below T
only to jack them X higher across the River.

Second, not satisfied,
it lets the hiker come back into view of the T
only to ratchet them slowly higher and higher
In the midday heat
the NK seems almost gleeful
about making the hiker feel
that they are climbing a down escalator:
ever stepping higher and higher
yet always seeing the rocks above them recede yeah.

Finally,
the NK lures the hiker fully halfway up the BAC valley
through familiar basement rocks
before sweeping that final anchor,
that last tinge? of link? to ?,
that last vestige of sanity,
away.
Having offered one last familiar prop and support
it then sheerly? knocks it away,
leaving the hiker to sprawl and gape among
searching for meaning, searching
for a familiar cliff somewhere in the bright wilderness of rock.
