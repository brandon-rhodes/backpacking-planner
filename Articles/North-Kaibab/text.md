Grand Canyon hikes start at rim.
White cliffs and red cliffs.

Looking down
standard layers:
the vast white cliffs of $Pc
that often stand 300 feet high.
Only if you hike in might you appreciate
that the and below them twice as thick $Mr,
rearing 600 feet and even higher.

Whether hiking in or out these layers steady reference
Whether down dry South Kaibab to Oo-Aah or beyond,
or past the spigots and shelters of the Bright Angel Trail
as far as Indian Gardens,
the white cliffs and red cliffs keep the hiker happily oriented.

# Loomings

The brisk pace down South Kaibab
brings the hiker to the Tip-Off mid-morning,
when he might even describe the air as still morning cool
rather than ominously hot.
Just nth of a mile further and the trail leaves the Tonto Platform,
committing itself to the final thousand-foot descent to the River.

The view as the trail cuts down switchbacks is nearly comforting.
Ahead, the hiker can see all the familiar layers
in ordered sanity.
High in the far distance the $Pc
decorates the edge of the North Rim like frosting,
while mighty ramparts of $Mr wrap the skirts of the mighty Vishnu Temple
ahead across the river.
Closer at hand, the familiar $Ct$ holds out last stand
before the $Xbr and $Xgr plunging down to the Colorado
already peeking out behind the gentle red slopes.

Wait — gentle red slopes?

The hiker happily plunging,
different view around each corner,
doesn’t know it yet,
but these gentle red slopes are a warning:
hiker has received his warning:
pass.

Moment in *All the King’s Men*

> “How life is strange and changeful, and the crystal is in the steel at
> the point of fracture, and the toad bears a jewel in its forehead, and
> the meaning of moments passes like the breeze that scarcely ruffles
> the leaf of the willow.”

If the hiker had only the time to stop think
at this moment their mental map broken

There shouldn’t be a red layer here.

By all rights there should only be schist and granite
below the Tapeats.
The great pattern
that has always sustained the hiker
is here broken.

But if only rim to river, easily ignored:
the descent soon reaches the basement rocks the hiker expects,
and the bright red slope is too easily
dismissed.

But the hiker has here received their warning:
the Canyon’s geology rules more complicated.
Down bridge, across creek delta,
refill water
happily hike north,
has already received warning.
But,
he doesn’t have ears to hear.

# The Box

It’s here at Bright Angel Campground,
as the hiker refills the bottles before heading north into the unknown,
that we can begin to follow his progress
along George Billingsley’s section D–D′.
Gradual climb.

Observe here how cunningly the Canyon offers evidence,
if only the hiker in the growing heat
would stop and look upslope.
While the rocks near at hand beside the trail
are reassuring,
the basement $Xr that ought yes,
That’s $Yh poking out.
Odd that this exception to the rule
should have followed the hiker across the river
and be troubling the slopes above them.
Isn’t it odd that the $Ct wouldn’t be immediately underlain
unconformity with the basement rocks?

Also the $Ct, while familiar,
ought really to give the hiker pause,
by its position.
But it’s difficult to judge distances at a steep angle overhead and,
anyway, it’s beginning to get rather hot
even though the Sun is not yet fully illuminating the Box.

And the Canyon here issues a third and final warning:
Familiar unconformity.

But isn’t the $Ct rather high here?

In the back of the hiker’s mind is a gauge,
a geologic gauge that he expects
will meter his climb back out of the Canyon.
As the layers stately descent,
so they will now climb.

Imagine, then, the problem Mile 2.

Remember the $Ct on the south side of the River?

By this time thoughts are beginning to grow hazy in the growing heat,
but the hiker remembers the Tapeats being not
that very high above the Colorado.
Maybe 3.5k.
As they finish Mile 2 in the Box and start earning Mile 3,
they expect their steady tread
to be steadily bringing the Tapeats closer.

Alas!

The section shows the dismal truth:
with each foot of elevation the hiker gains,
the Canyon is quietly pulling the Tapeats a nearly equal distance higher.
The hiker climbs another hundred feet uphill;
quietly, without fanfare,
the Tapeats nearly matches them with another 80? feet.

The hiker is very nearly on a geologic treadmill:
the

Yet the hiker doesn’t yet realize their predicament.
Their eyes stray upward only occasionally
staying mainly level to watch the fascinating twists and turns of the Box.
The trail crosses weighty bridges,
mighty berms and walls reared against the cliffs
by the Civilian Conservation Corps,
heroes of old. [use KJV]

And, after all, it’s difficult for the novice
to judge the elevation of unconformity
from hundreds of feet below.

By Mile 3,
the trap has nearly closed upon the hiker
if only they knew it.
They have now climbed more than 500 feet
above the level of the Colorado.
Yet the Tapeats have risen to match their progress!
Its base now stands at more than 4000 feet elevation.

The hiker has made no progress.

start ~1+k below Tapeats

Lesson:
even the “horizontal” layers of the Canyon
have a gradual slope.
this is why N rim is deeper, because it slopes south

# Into the Great Wide Open

The hiker has so far not registered anything unusual.
Not looking upslope.

Canyon is very cleverly concealing its.
While gradually lifting the $Ct ever higher,
and slowing beginning to add extra layers
through which the hiker will have to climb,
it has kept the walls at either hand plainly familiar.
The Box continues to wind back and forth
between angled ramparts of $Xr and $Xgr
and the hiker might well believe
that.

And then the moment comes when the Canyon springs the trap
so elaborately laid:
just at Mile 4,
it sweeps aside its props,
pulls aside the curtains of basement rock,
and disgorges the hiker

The basement rocks, atop which he imagined the Tapeats rearing,

The walls open up,

Lesson: the Great Unconformity may be great,
but it’s not everywhere.
The Tapeats does not everywhere enjoy the privilege
of resting atop the mighty basement of granite and schist —
and the valley of Bright Angel Creek is one of those places!
Before you will be allowed to again meet the Tapeats
and the Canyon’s other horizontal layers,
the North Kaibab Trail ascends through no less than 5 layers
of the mighty Grand Canyon Supergroup.

# Reeling it in

The question of whether the Tapeats have flitted away
and abandoned the hiker in the heat
not entirely silly:
the hiker is approaching the valley of Ribbon Falls,
where an ancient hard hill of Shinumo Quartzite
stood tall enough that the sea was only able to deposit Tapeats around it
— or allowed it to deposit but then washed it away.

Hill!

Either way,
the result is an unconformity along the south valley edge of Ribbon Falls
where the $Cba sits directly atop the Supergroup’s $Ys
without the Tapeats as an intervening layer.
The unconformity itself will be clearest if,
on a later trip,
the hiker has leisure to explore the valley of Ribbon Falls itself:

But even today,
when the hiker must avoid expense to veer neither left nor right
while broiling uphill through the sun,
he will sense something missing atop the walls
that hem him in to the left —
that a constant, a reassurance, an anchor
has momentarily been withdrawn from him
as the Canyon shimmers ever more emphatically in the heat.

Or more colloquially,
“You’re off the edge of the map, mate. Here there be monsters.”

of little drainage between eastern feet of Manu Temple,

Previous photo was taken from the bottom of the Transept
which exits the lower left of this photo,
looking up at a very close exposure of the $Ct
behind which reared the $Mr and $Pc thousands of feet above.

From this angle we can see what the hiker,
still broiling in the creek valley,
cannot:
that the ordeal of low altitude desert is nearly over.

After the hiker with heat stroke tries another mile? + half?,
the hikers will attempt another mile past Cottonwood Campground,
but stop again at Manzanita Rest Area —
just off the right edge of our geologic section,
where the trail finally reaches the Tapeats.

There at Rest Area the other hiker rests again in the shade —
only to suddenly come alive again
as the westerning Sun falls behind the high cliffs
along the west edge of the creek.
They stand to their feet, hoist their daypack,
and, yeah.

Everything is restored:
there are Rest Area,
now standing at the bottom of the Tapeats,
with same distance to go as from bottom of Tapeats on South Rim.
The North Kaibab Trail here leaves Bright Angel Creek
and angles up the green valley
you can see at the center right of the photo above:
Roaring Springs,
cool north-facing cliff faces,
and up all the layers to the trailhead.

Except in the dark because exhaustion so not at top til [LATE?].

Lesson:
n kaibab does not stretch out layers
you are already used to
instead it introduces new ones
n kaibab doesn’t let you make any headway against horizontal layers
until you are ready to leave the valley of bright angel creek.
only as you turn aside will you start climbing red etc.

So:
yeah like being in statis or something,
8 miles without accomplishing anything.
(Stats from above.)

Finally catch $Ct at elevation of Manzanita R A.

Won’t enjoy, darkness will fall.

(Conclusion?)
