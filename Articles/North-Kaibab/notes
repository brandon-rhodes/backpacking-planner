Ideas:
By this time thoughts are beginning to grow hazy in the growing heat,
The hiker is very nearly on a geologic treadmill.
It sweeps aside its props,
pulls aside the curtains of basement rock,
and disgorges the hiker.
as the westerning Sun falls behind the high cliffs

Photo boys: (88/63 if I want more Ys)
Verify height of Redwall on BAT; other sources say 500-800 feet.

Given that on June 1st I say “Saturday”,
the hike must have been on: Saturday June 7 2014.
When matching photos, don’t look at rocks, look at bushes.

== Miles Bright Angel Trail takes to rise from Tapeats to Rim ==

Per standard PDF, rim to Indian Garden: (+ 1.6 1.5 1.7) 4.8
But, per “Day Hike - Bright Angel Trail”: 4.5

From Indian Garden to Great Unconformity: 0.98 miles,
drawing a Google Earth path from the mule corral
to what the geologic map indicates is where the path crosses.
So we’ll round up to 1.0 miles.

Total: (+ 4.5 1.0) 5.5 miles

== Miles North Kaibab Trail takes to rise from Tapeats to Rim ==

From PDF, Rim to Manzanita is: (- 6.8 1.4) 5.4 miles
From Cottonwood to Manzanita: 1.4 miles

== Miles South Kaibab Trail takes to rise from Tapeats to Rim ==

From PDF, Rim to Tip Off: (- 7.0 2.6) 4.4 miles = (+ 1.5 1.5 1.4) 4.4 miles
From Tip off to unconformity: ¼ miles, measured on Google Earth
Total: (+ 4.4 0.25) 4.65 = maybe round up to 4¾ miles

So from Tapeats to River, measuring 0.36 bridge->BACG: (- 2.6 0.25 0.36) 1.99

== Experiment with another font in SVG ==

Put this in SVG, after moving the font into the ~/.fonts directory:

<style type="text/css"><![CDATA[
    text {
        font-family: "Andika Regular";
    }
  ]]></style>

== Slopes ==

SKT spends (- 2.6 0.25) 2.35 miles below Taps
BAT spends (- 9.5 1.5 5.5) 2.5 miles below Taps
NKT spends (- 14.0 5.5) 8.5 miles below Taps = (/ 8.5 2.5) 3.4

North Kaibab middle: (/ (- 4600 2475) 8.0) 265.625 feet per mile
Tapeats along same: (/ (- 4600 3500) 8.0) 137.5 feet per mile

== Effect of Tapeats rise ==

Vs Tapeats south of river (3600 is quick guess):

Climb without Tapeats moving: (- 3600 2475) 1125
Climb with Tapeats moving: (- 4600 2475) 2125
(/ 2125.0 1125) 1.8888888888888888

Vs Tapeats N of Phantom Creek (3900 is also a bit of a guess):

Climb without Tapeats moving: (- 3900 2475) 1425
Climb with Tapeats moving: (- 4600 2475) 2125
(/ 2125.0 1425) 1.4912280701754386

== Image locations ==

South Supergroup image 2020 Dec 6 15:48 ET: the Redwall peeking out at
the upper left matches the 3rd (counting from the south) of the 4 east
arms of Buddha Temple, so the two Redwall buttresses belong to Clement
Powell Butte.  We seem to be looking at the right/north buttress nearly
edge-on, so we’re presumably even with it, or very nearly.

North Supergroup image 2020 Dec 6 15:34 ET: the bay holding this orange
wedge of rock must be sheer enough to make it invisible from the air, as
I don’t see such an exposure on Google Earth.  But as it was taken only
(- 48 34) 14 minutes earlier during my southbound hike, it’s at most (*
3.0 (/ 14 60.0)) 0.7 miles north of the south photo. I believe the photo
shows the bay of the side drainage at 36.1523° N, which as required has
trees beside the trail; slopes to left and right; a large house-sized
rock; and, the nose of the right slope is covered with a nearly matching
pattern of rocks/boulders, and the bushes up on the red slope match.
Panning back in Google Earth, this is, in fact, a pour-off at the bottom
of the drainage that runs from between the two Redwall arms of the Manu
Temple, which are too far west to appear on the cross section.

Later photos, takenon another trip (EST):
14:48 Still above Ribbon Falls.
15:34 (46m) First photo, looking at orange rock between talus slopes.
15:48 (14m) Second photo, looking at angled layers beneath Tapeats.
15:57 (9m) Where basement rock emerges from ground.
