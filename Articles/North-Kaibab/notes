(+ 2200 450) 2650  ; plus the Redwall

(+ (/ 350 2) 300 950 (/ 450 2)) 1650 ; Middle of Coconino to middle of Redwall

(- 1 (/ 350.0 450.0)) 0.2222222222222222

== Miles Bright Angel Trail takes to rise from Tapeats to Rim ==

Per standard PDF, rim to Indian Garden: (+ 1.6 1.5 1.7) 4.8
But, per “Day Hike - Bright Angel Trail”: 4.5

From Indian Garden to Great Unconformity: 0.98 miles,
drawing a Google Earth path from the mule corral
to what the geologic map indicates is where the path crosses.
So we’ll round up to 1.0 miles.

Total: (+ 4.5 1.0) 5.5 miles

== Miles North Kaibab Trail takes to rise from Tapeats to Rim ==

From PDF, Rim to Manzanita is: (- 6.8 1.4) 5.4 miles
From Cottonwood to Manzanita: 1.4 miles

== Miles South Kaibab Trail takes to rise from Tapeats to Rim ==

From PDF, Rim to Tip Off: (- 7.0 2.6) 4.4 miles = (+ 1.5 1.5 1.4) 4.4 miles
From Tip off to unconformity: ¼ miles, measured on Google Earth
Total: (+ 4.4 0.25) 4.65 = maybe round up to 4¾ miles

So from Tapeats to River, measuring 0.36 bridge->BACG: (- 2.6 0.25 0.36) 1.99

== Experiment with another font in SVG ==

Put this in SVG, after moving the font into the ~/.fonts directory:

<style type="text/css"><![CDATA[
    text {
        font-family: "Andika Regular";
    }
  ]]></style>

== Slopes ==

SKT spends (- 2.6 0.25) 2.35 miles below Taps
BAT spends (- 9.5 1.5 5.5) 2.5 miles below Taps
NKT spends (- 14.0 5.5) 8.5 miles below Taps = (/ 8.5 2.5) 3.4

North Kaibab middle: (/ (- 4600 2475) 8.0) 265.625 feet per mile
Tapeats along same: (/ (- 4600 3500) 8.0) 137.5 feet per mile
(/ 265 137.0) 1.9343065693430657

South Supergroup image 2020 Dec 6 15:48 ET: the Redwall peeking out at
the upper left matches the 3rd (counting from the south) of the 4 east
arms of Buddha Temple, so the two Redwall buttresses belong to Clement
Powell Butte.  We seem to be looking at the right/north buttress nearly
edge-on, so we’re presumably even with it, or very nearly.

North Supergroup image 2020 Dec 6 15:34 ET: the bay holding this orange
wedge of rock must be sheer enough to make it invisible from the air, as
I don’t see such an exposure on Google Earth.  But as it was taken only
(- 48 34) 14 minutes earlier during my southbound hike, it’s at most (*
3.0 (/ 14 60.0)) 0.7 miles north of the south photo. I believe the photo
shows the bay of the side drainage at 36.1523° N, which as required has
trees beside the trail; slopes to left and right; a large house-sized
rock; and, the nose of the right slope is covered with a nearly matching
pattern of rocks/boulders, and the bushes up on the red slope match.
Panning back in Google Earth, this is, in fact, a pour-off at the bottom
of the drainage that runs from between the two Redwall arms of the Manu
Temple, which are too far west to appear on the cross section.
